# The Split Forty Five

A small mechanical keyboard for those who cannot decide if they are ancient or modern.

* "Traditional" row-staggered layout
* Split for better ergonomics
* Based on the Nice!Nano controller for very low power consumption
* Uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) both to connect each half and to connect to the computer
